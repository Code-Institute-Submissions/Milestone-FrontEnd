# Front End Milestone Project - *Restaurant Website*

This milestone project demonstrates my ability to create a static website using *HTML5, CCS and CDNs*.

The website is for a restaurant and its aim is to attract customers to boost its sales.  The main page will quickly give users an idea of the style of food available and ethos of the company.  This website also includes an online menu with prices and expandable nutrition/allergen info, also available as a downloadable PDF.  A location page with map link and opening hours.

The restaurant is aimed at health conscious workers.  A customer event/loyalty page will encourage repeat custom via events, discounts and free one off workplace lunch deliveries by draw.


## UX

This website is for health conscious workers looking to buy good quality, healthy fast food.  
Primarily the users will want to view the different menu items quickly to make a dining choice.  The best way to achieve this is a quick modern looking interface to access these choices with as few clicks as possible, from the main page which will have a “dish of the day” the rest of the menu will be accessible by one click.

##### User stories
* As Bob I'm a previous customer, I want to choose something to eat because I'm hungry.
* As Charlie, a friend recommended the restaurant, I want to find out where it is so I can visit.
* As Sue, an allergy sufferer, I want to view the allergens in the food so I don’t have a bad reaction.
* As Bill, a serial customer, I want to know this week's event, so I can try to win the office delivery draw.
* As Pat, a health conscious person, I want to know the nutrition information of my lunch, so I can stay within my nutrition boundaries.
* As Frank, a shift worker, I want to know the opening hours, so I am not wasting a trip to the restaurant.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
