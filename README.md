# <p style="text-align: center;">**Fresh Green - Restaurant**</p>
[FreshGreen Website link](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/ 'FreshGreen website GitHub pages link')
 
A stylish reactive mobile first website for FreshGreen restaurant to attract customers and increase repeat custom.  FreshGreen caters to workers for eat in and take-away
healthy food. FreswhGreen is aimed at workers looking for quick healthy food and will be designed to give this impression via color palet and background images throughout the site.
 
The FreshGreen website will allow a customer to quickly find all critical information in as few clicks as possible while keeping a slick uncluttered look.  While browsing the 
customer will be funneled to one of the restaurants USPs, a **QR quick order code**, allowing fast purchase from one of the restaurant's take-away kiosk.
 
Business goals
* Promote brand awareness
* Drive custom and repeat custom to the restaurant
* Promote use of self service to reduce need for front of house staff during peak periods
* Increase sales from customers with allergens by including allergy information simply
 
Customer goals
* Easy to use UX for accessibility to all needed information
* Easy to read menu items that give customer more information when clicked
* Quick ordering process
* Give customers who suffer from allergies quick access to menu item allergens
* Quick access to location and opening hours
* One click navigation to important information
 
## UX
 
Visitors to this site will be choosing something to eat or finding out more information about the restaurant.  All design is built keeping these core tasks in mind.
 
This website is customer based, and will be viewed mostly on mobile devices as repeat customers will ideally use the no sign-up ordering function through their device.
To achieve best results in this case the UX needs to be simple and allow the user to reach their information through as few clicks as possible.  Because of
screen size limitations of mobile devices the UI will be mostly vertically stacked, but for our desktop users the website will reorder into a wider column based 
design.  Both designs allow the user to view its content without showing too much information at any one time.
