## UX

#### Project Purpose

This websites purpose is to promote the FreshGreen brand while attracting customers and increasing repeat custom.  

### Business Goals

* Deliver a customer centric website. 
* Promote brand awareness
* Drive custom and repeat custom to the restaurant
* Promote use of self service to reduce need for front of house staff during peak periods
* Increase sales from customers with allergens by including allergy information
 
### Customers Experience

As a mobile first customer centric website it must be lightweight, simple to use and not have too much information displayed at any one time.  
This site was designed with consistency in mind, and is intuitive to use.  The main features of this site are accessible in one click and ordered in a sensible fashion.  
Below are goals the customer should expect from this site.

* Simple user interface
* One click navigation to important information
* Easy to read/select food items
* Extra information on food items when needed
* Access to allergen information
* Access to opening hours and location
* Quick ordering process

### User stories
* As a previous customer, I want to choose something to eat because I'm hungry.
* As Charlie, a friend recommended the restaurant, I want to find out where it is so I can visit.
* As an allergy sufferer, I want to view the allergen information so I donâ€™t have a bad reaction.
* As a serial customer, I want to know this week's event because it adds value to my visit
* As Bob, I want to try to win the office delivery draw because I want to win lunch for my workmates.
* As a health conscious person, I want to know the ingredients of my lunch, so I can stay within my nutrition boundaries.
* As Paulie, I want to order without talking to anyone, I want this service option.
* As a shift worker, I want to know the opening hours, so I am not wasting a trip to a closed restaurant. 

### Design Choices

* Backgrounds 
    - Images of healthy food ingredients were used to reinforce the image FreshGreen wants to impress on its customers, the backgrounds simple yet themed convey the ethos of FreshGreen to its customers.

* Colours
    - To again reinforce FreshGreens image, a light green color has been used on the text headings and menu titles, where extra information is displayed in a neutral off-white.  Any critical information/functionality (Allergen information and some buttons) are orange to attract attention and contrast with the site to make sure users do not miss it.

* Fonts
    - To align with the fresh, organic, green style of the restaurant the font [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=Caveat 'Link to caveat font') was chosen for the logo for its naturally written but readable style.
    - The font [Kavivanar](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kavivanar?query=Kavivanar 'Link to Kavivanar') was chosen as the main font for information on the site again for its more natural and less clinical feel than more angular fonts.  This font was much better than the above logo font for readability of longer sentences.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
 
##### Main page
The front page of the website is as simple as possible while giving the user the ability to get to any page in one click, the page only gets "busy" as you scroll down and want to see more images of the restaurant / food for sale.
* Large buttons to MENU / EVENTS / LOCATION
* A hero image to set the tone of the company ethos and expected type of product.
* Social media buttons as a footer on mobile, these will hide before they clash with navigation buttons.
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Menu Item Page
This page is made to allow the customer to quickly scan through menu items and get an idea of what they may want to order.
* Menu items shown through a picture and descriptive text
* Menu items are clickable, opening up a larger image in a bootstrap modal, this gives more information on nutrition and allergens.  
* From the menu item model there is a QR order button that exposes a QR code to self service order in the restaurant.
  
##### Events page
The events page is to encourage repeat custom.
* Current weekly event, to give users a reason to revisit the website regularly
* Weekly draw, to give users an extra incentive to order from FreshGreen
* Events page **enter draw** form is available as a modal accessed through a button on mobile or displayed immediately in a column on larger screens.
* The **draw** form takes the below inputs from the user, correct formats needed for email and entry code :-
    * Name
    * Email
    * Entry Code (5 digit code on receipt)
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Location page
The location page simply gives customers the ability to locate / contact and find opening hours of the restaurant.
* Opening hours
* Clickable phone number
* Address and an embedded google maps link with GPS coordinates.
* If viewing the map on smaller screens the opening hours are not usually visible, in this case a prominent **Opening Hours** button will appear on screen with a direct link to them to avoid the user missing this information.
* On larger screens the **Opening Hours** button is not needed so will be hidden.
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Global features
* Navigation will collapse to a menu icon on mobile to avoid the screen being too busy, in this case social media icons will be displayed as a Footer.
* Some background image positions/magnifications change depending on screen width.
* Background images are available in different resolutions depending on screen resolution starting with lower resolutions for mobile, to reduce used bandwidth and speed up site load times over mobile.
* Responsive design will rearrange buttons / images / columns / tables to appropriate sizes depending on resolution of screen **as shown in wireframes**.
* Social media icons move to the top navigation bar at higher resolutions.
* Width of some elements are capped to avoid ugly layout and stretched items at very high resolutions.
* simple javascript button to show hide image.
* FontAwesome icons.
* Google fonts.
* bootstrap.
 
### Features Left to Implement
* None
 
### Features removed or changed during development
* Removed : Allergen information placed on to picture of food item
    - Reason : Image looked messy or icons were too small and unreadable so were removed but can still be seen when item is clicked
* Changed : Index page buttons stack underneath hero image on small screens
    - Reason : Buttons could be off page, placing them on hero image created a better looking UI
* Changed : Menu page items have text next to image on mobile
    - Reason : Text was too small, text moved below menu item
* Changed : Menu page items are on a double column on larger screens
    - Reason : Information overload, replaced with single column of items
 
### Future features
* GDPR compliance
* Language select
* Add drinks option to QR checkout code

Process
* Locally from GitPod files were added by `git add .` or `git add (filename)`

* Being the only contributor to this project I did not have to contend with any merges
* If a feature did not work out the project was rolled back to a previous commit (labeled by an appropriate commit message) process below
    - Find the commit you want to restore on your remote master branch and get the first 6 commit numbers
    - run this command `git reset --hard #the first 6 commit numbers here`
