# Front End Milestone Project - *Restaurant Website*

This milestone project demonstrates my ability to create a static website using **HTML5, CCS and CDNs**.

The website is for a restaurant and its aim is to attract customers to boost its sales and give the user a QR code for self service payment.  
The main page quickly gives users an idea of the style of food available and ethos of the company.  This website also includes an **online 
menu** with prices and expandable nutrition/allergen info, and **QR code** for quick ordering.  A **location page** with map link and opening hours.

The restaurant is aimed at health conscious workers.  A customer **Event** page will encourage repeat custom via events, discounts and free 
one off workplace lunch deliveries by draw.


## UX

This website is for health conscious workers looking to buy good quality, healthy fast food.  
Primarily the users will want to view the different menu items quickly to make a dining choice.  The best way to achieve this is a quick modern 
looking interface to access these choices with as few clicks as possible, from the main page which will have a “dish of the day” the rest of the 
menu and location information will be accessible by one click.

#### User stories
* As Bob I'm a previous customer, I want to choose something to eat because I'm hungry.
* As Charlie, a friend recommended the restaurant, I want to find out where it is so I can visit.
* As Sue, an allergy sufferer, I want to view the allergens in the food so I don’t have a bad reaction.
* As Bill, a serial customer, I want to know this week's event, so I can try to win the office delivery draw.
* As Pat, a health conscious person, I want to know the nutrition information of my lunch, so I can stay within my nutrition boundaries.
* As Frank, a shift worker, I want to know the opening hours, so I am not wasting a trip to the restaurant. 
* As Paulie, I want to order without talking to anyone, I will use the QR code and self service option.
