# <p style="text-align: center;">**FreshGreen - Restaurant**</p>
[FreshGreen Website link](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/ 'FreshGreen website GitHub pages link')
 
A stylish reactive mobile first website for FreshGreen restaurant to attract customers and increase repeat custom.  FreshGreen caters to workers for eat in and take-away
healthy food, and is designed to give this impression via color palette and background images throughout the site.
 
The FreshGreen website will allow a customer to quickly find all critical information in as few clicks as possible while keeping a slick uncluttered look.  While browsing the 
customer will be funneled to one of the restaurants USPs, a **QR quick order code**, allowing fast purchase from one of the restaurant's take-away kiosks.
 
Business goals
* Promote brand awareness
* Drive custom and repeat custom to the restaurant
* Promote use of self service to reduce need for front of house staff during peak periods
* Increase sales from customers with allergens by including allergy information
 
Customer goals
* Easy to use UX for accessibility to all needed information
* Easy to read menu items that give customer more information when clicked
* Quick ordering process
* Give customers who suffer from allergies quick access to menu item allergens
* Quick access to location and opening hours
* One click navigation to important information
 
## UX
 
Visitors to this site will be choosing something to eat or finding out more information about the restaurant.  All design is built keeping these core tasks in mind.
 
This website is customer based, and will be viewed mostly on mobile devices. To achieve best results the UX needs to be simple and allow the user to reach their information through as few clicks as possible.  Because of
screen size limitations of mobile devices the UI will be mostly vertically stacked, but for our desktop users the website will reorder into a wider column based design.  Both designs allow the user to view its content without cluttering the screen.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
 
##### Main page
The front page of the website is as simple as possible while giving the user the ability to get to any page in one click, the page only gets "busy" as you scroll down and want to see more images of the restaurant / food for sale.
* A hero image to set the tone of the company ethos and expected type of product.  This will have links to all other pages on the site through main page buttons and navbar.
* Footer on the index page will hide before it clashes with navigation buttons (for lower resolution screens).
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Menu Item Page
This page is made to allow the customer to quickly scan through menu items and get an idea of what they may want, extra information is only shown if the user clicks an item to avoid information overload.
* Shows off the restaurant's menu items through a picture and simple descriptive text
* Menu items are clickable, opening up a larger image in a bootstrap modal, this gives more information on nutrition and allergens.  
* From the menu item model there is a QR order button that exposes a QR code to self service order in the restaurant.
 
 
##### Events page
The events page is to encourage repeat custom, having a page updated weekly gives users a reason to revisit the site even if they already know the menu.
* A page to show current events and enter a weekly delivery draw.  This page's goal is to give the customers a reason to regularly access the website.
* Events page **enter draw** form is available as a modal accessed through a button on mobile or displayed immediately in a column on larger screens.
* The **draw** form takes the below inputs from the user, correct formats needed for email and entry code :-
    * Name
    * Email
    * Entry Code (5 digit code on receipt)
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Location page
The location page simply gives customers the ability to locate / contact and find opening hours of the restaurant.
* A simple page with opening hours, clickable phone number, address and an embedded google maps link and GPS coordinates.
* If viewing the map on smaller screens the opening hours are not usually visible, in this case a prominent **Opening Hours** button will appear on screen with a direct link to them to avoid the user missing this information.
* On larger screens the **Opening Hours** button is not needed so will be hidden.
* A reactive set of images of the restaurant and pictures of some food available will be at the bottom of the page, if clicked links to [Menu Page](https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/menu.html "Menu page for FreshGreen")
 
##### Global features
* Some background image positions/magnifications change depending on screen width.
* Background images are available in different resolutions depending on screen resolution starting with lower resolutions for mobile, to reduce used bandwidth and speed up site load times over mobile.
* Responsive design will rearrange buttons / images / columns / tables to appropriate sizes depending on resolution of screen **as shown in wireframes**.
* Navigation will collapse to a menu icon on mobile to avoid the screen being too busy, in this case social media icons will be displayed as a Footer.
* Social media icons move to the top navigation bar at higher resolutions.
* Width of some elements are capped to avoid ugly layout and stretched items at very high resolutions.
* simple javascript button to show hide image.
* FontAwesome icons.
* Google fonts.
* bootstrap.
 
### Features Left to Implement
* None
 
### Features removed/changed during development
* Removed : Allergen information placed on to picture of food item
    - Reason : Image looked messy or icons were too small and unreadable so were removed but can still be seen when item is clicked
* Changed : Index page buttons stack underneath hero image on small screens
    - Reason : Buttons could be off page, placing them on hero image created a better looking UI
* Changed : Menu page items have text next to image on mobile
    - Reason : Text was too small, text moved below menu item
* Changed : Menu page items are on a double column on larger screens
    - Reason : Information overload, replaced with single column of items
 
### Future features
* GDPR compliance
* Language select
* Add drinks option to QR checkout code

## Deployment
 
### Deployment Location
Website created and developed in GitPod, version controlled with Git and hosted on GitHub
 
The template used to start this project was from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ 'Code Institute link') and was the [Code Institute - GitPod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template 'Code Institue GitPod template')
This template sets up some config files, installs tools such as Heroku, MongoDB, MySql and python extensions to GitPod.
 
To use this template on GitHub
* Log into GitHub.
* Visit [Code Institute - GitPod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template 'Code Institue GitPod template') and select the green **Use this template** button.
* On the next page give this new repository a name, description and press the green **Create repository from template** button.
 
#### Using git
During development the project was version controlled using Git. [Commit History](https://github.com/KelvinHere/Milestone-FrontEnd/commits/master 'GitHub commit history for FreshGreen')
 
Process
* Locally from GitPod files were added by `git add .` or `git add (filename)`
* Files were then committed to the local master branch with `git commit -m "Appropriate message describing commit"`
* The local master branch was then pushed to the remote master branch located on **GitHub** the code hosting platform, through the command `git push`
* Being the only contributor to this project I did not have to contend with any merges
* If a feature did not work out the project was rolled back to a previous commit (labeled by an appropriate commit message) process below
    - Find the commit you want to restore on your remote master branch and get the first 6 commit numbers
    - run this command `git reset --hard #the first 6 commit numbers here`
    - The project will be restored to this commit point
