# Front End Milestone Project - *Restaurant Website*

This milestone project demonstrates my ability to create a "mobile first" website using **HTML5, CCS and CDNs**.

Website Link : https://kelvinhere.github.io/Milestone-FrontEnd/

This restaurant is aimed at workers looking for quick healthy food and will be designed to give this impression via color palet and background images through the site.

This restaurant websites aim is to attract customers and boost sales.  The main page quickly gives users an idea of the style of food available and ethos of the company.  This website also includes an **online 
menu** with prices and expandable nutrition/allergen information and **QR code** for quick automatic ordering.  A **location page** with map link and opening hours. A customer **Event** page will encourage repeat custom via weekly events, discounts and free workplace lunch deliveries won by draw.

## UX

This website is for health conscious workers looking to buy good quality, healthy fast food.  
Primarily the users will want to view the different menu items quickly to make a dining choice.  The best way to achieve this is a quick modern 
looking interface to access these choices with as few clicks as possible, from the main page the rest of the menu and location information are accessible by one click.
